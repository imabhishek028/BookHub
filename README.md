## About the Task:

Spider Software Induction Task 2 by Abhishek Jha, 110123005.

This task was my first experience of learning backend and creating a full stack app. I have encorporated Mongo Atlas, Node.js and Express for backend. I have completed Level 1 and 2. I have tried to have a bug free application along with additional features like App Icon.

There are areas that could have been improved specially in code writing, backend code could have been more clean. Moreover provided more time, I could have completed Level 3 as well. 

It was a wonderfull learning experience. Looking forward to onsites and PIs.
# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_  shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
